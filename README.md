ðŸ”— Discord Developer Docs - https://discord.com/developers/docs/quick-start/getting-started

2. Obtain YouTube Cookies (Optional but Recommended)

Some videos require authentication to be played properly. To avoid restrictions, you can provide YouTube cookies:

    Export cookies from your web browser.
    Use cookies from an incognito session (logged in).

3. Install Dependencies

Make sure you have Node.js installed, then run:

npm install

4. Configure the Bot

Create a .env file in the project directory and add:

DISCORD_TOKEN=your-bot-token-here
YOUTUBE_COOKIES=your-cookie-string-here

5. Run the Bot
    Check Your Project Files:
        Make sure you have the following:
            main.py (your bot script).
            .env file (with your bot token).
            requirements.txt (optional, if you have a list of dependencies).
        Your .env file should contain the line:

    DISCORD_TOKEN=your-bot-token-here

Install Python Dependencies:

    Open a terminal in your project directory.

    Ensure your terminal/command prompt is in the directory where main.py is located.
    Run the bot using the following command:

python main.py
